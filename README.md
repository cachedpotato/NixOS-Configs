# NixOS Configs

Hello and Welcome! There isn't a lot to see here but I hope you enjoy your brief stay here.

## Why NixOS?
I've always wanted to try out Linux ever since Windows 11 became a pain in the butt to manage.
While I was skimming through various Distros, NixOS stood out to me as...Peculiar. It was radically differnt from others, and the fact that a) everything can be configured declaratively and b) It is highly reproducible caught my attention.
Without too much thinking I thought to myself "eh why not" and jumped right in, and here we are.
Do I know anything about Linux? I mean not really. Am I experiencing issues? yes, a bunch actually. Am I having fun despite all this? Yes.
As I've mentioned before, I know next to nothing about linux, so whatever config I'm doing now will be, frankly speaking, bad. Nobody should ever want to use my setup, at least for now.
Still, I think (or at least hope) I'm learning a few things everyday, so I hope to one day be competent enough to make a decent setup.

## Directories
- /home: home-manager configs.
- /themes: base16/base24 themes from [](). Used for styling purposes.
- /wallpapers: ...wallpapers. used for hyprpaper and can also be used to create my own color scheme using stylix.
- /hosts: list of hosts. currently only have one, but I'm planning on creating more.
- /system: all the system related goodies, such as boot, bluetoooth, security, etc.
- /dev: currently being used as a testing ground for nix-shell. I say testing ground, but I really haven't done anything with it.

## Inspiration
If you've looked through my setup and thought to yourself: "wait a moment I've seen this before" then you'd be correct. I've "borrowed" a bunch of configs from other people who actually knows what they're doing, unlike me.
Below is the list of people I've gotten inspiration from:

- fufexan
- LibrePhoenix
- EmergentMind
- GaetanLepage

Chances are you've  seen these people's configs already, but just in case you haven't please do check them out.

Also special thanks to the NixOS reddit for being extra helpful! I wouldn't have come this far without their help.
